A simple API to authenticate PESU credentials using PESU Academy.

The API is secure and protects user privacy by not storing any user credentials. It only validates credentials and
returns the user's profile information. No personal data is stored.

## PESUAuth LIVE Deployment

* You can access the PESUAuth API endpoints [here](https://pesu-auth.onrender.com/).
* You can view the health status of the API on the [PESUAuth Health Dashboard](https://xzlk85cp.status.cron-job.org/).

> :warning: **Warning:** The live version is hosted on a free tier server, so you might experience some latency on the
> first request since the server might not be awake. Subsequent requests will be faster.

## How to run PESUAuth locally

Running the PESUAuth API locally is simple. Clone the repository and follow the steps below to get started.

### Running with Docker

This is the easiest and recommended way to run the API locally. Ensure you have Docker installed on your system. Run the
following commands to start the API.

1. Build the Docker image either from the source code or pull the pre-built image from Docker Hub.

    1. You can build the Docker image from the source code by running the following command in the root directory of
       the repository.

   ```bash
   docker build . --tag pesu-auth
   ```

    2. You can also pull the pre-built Docker image
       from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/aditeyabaral/pesu-auth/general) by running the
       following command:

   ```bash
   docker pull aditeyabaral/pesu-auth:latest
   ```

2. Run the Docker container

```bash
docker run --name pesu-auth -d -p 5000:5000 pesu-auth
# If you pulled the pre-built image, use the following command instead:
docker run --name pesu-auth -d -p 5000:5000 aditeyabaral/pesu-auth:latest
```

3. Access the API at `http://localhost:5000/`

### Running without Docker

If you don't have Docker installed, you can run the API using Python. Ensure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed
on your system.

1. Create a virtual environment using `conda`, `uv` or any other virtual environment manager of your choice and activate
   it. Then, install the dependencies using the following command.

#### For `conda` users:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### For `uv` users:

```bash
uv sync
```

2. Run the API using the following command.

#### For `conda` users:

```bash
python -m app.app
```

#### For `uv` users:

```bash
uv run python -m app.app
```

3. Access the API as previously mentioned.

## How to use the PESUAuth API

You can send a request to the `/authenticate` endpoint with the user's credentials and the API will return a JSON
object,
with the user's profile information if requested.

### Request Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Optional** | **Type**    | **Default** | **Description**                                                                                 |

| `username`    | No           | `str`       |             | The user's SRN or PRN                                                                           |
| `password`    | No           | `str`       |             | The user's password                                                                             |
| `profile`     | Yes          | `boolean`   | `False`     | Whether to fetch profile information                                                            |
| `fields`      | Yes          | `list[str]` | `None`      | Which fields to fetch from the profile information. If not provided, all fields will be fetched |

### Response Object

On authentication, it returns the following parameters in a JSON object. If the authentication was successful and
profile data was requested, the response's `profile` key will store a dictionary with a user's profile information.
**On an unsuccessful sign-in, this field will not exist**.

| **Field**   | **Type**        | **Description**                                                          |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `status`    | `boolean`       | A flag indicating whether the overall request was successful             |
| `profile`   | `ProfileObject` | A nested map storing the profile information, returned only if requested |
| `message`   | `str`           | A message that provides information corresponding to the status          |
| `timestamp` | `datetime`      | A timezone offset timestamp indicating the time of authentication        |

#### `ProfileObject`

This object contains the user's profile information, which is returned only if the `profile` parameter is set to `True`.
If the authentication fails, this field will not be present in the response.
